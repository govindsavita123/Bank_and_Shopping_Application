# Bank_and_Shopping_Application
---------------------------------------------
This project is a console-based C++ application that combines basic banking operations with a shopping system in a single program. The main goal of the project is to simulate real-life interactions between a user’s bank account and their shopping cart, using object-oriented programming concepts.

-----------------------------------
🔍 Overview
-----------------------------------
This project is a modular and object-oriented application developed in C++, combining both banking and shopping cart functionalities into one seamless system. It simulates a real-world scenario where a user can manage their bank account and use their balance to shop and pay bills securely.

-----------------------------------
💡 Key Features
-----------------------------------

-----------------------------------
🏦 Banking System
-----------------------------------
Deposit: Users can deposit money into their account.

Withdraw: Users can withdraw money after validating their password.

Balance Inquiry: Users can check their current balance at any time.

Password Protection: All sensitive actions are protected by password authentication.

----------------------------
🛍️ Shopping Cart
----------------------------
Users can browse and add items to a shopping cart.

The total cost of selected items is calculated.

Shopping is linked to the user’s bank account for direct payment.

--------------------------------
💳 Pay Bill – Friend Function
-------------------------------
A friend function is used to implement the Pay Bill feature.

This function allows the Bank and Shopping classes to interact securely.

It deducts the bill amount from the bank account only after password verification.

Ensures smooth and secure transactions between both systems.

------------------------------
🔐 Security & Validation
------------------------------
Passwords are used to protect the user's account and prevent unauthorized access.

Proper checks are in place to validate inputs like withdrawal limits and sufficient balance for payments.

Emphasizes data security and error handling for all operations.

----------------------------
🧠 Technical Highlights
----------------------------
Fully written in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles like:

Classes and Objects

Friend Functions

Encapsulation

The project is modular, meaning banking and shopping functionalities are in separate but connected classes.

Clean code structure and good programming practices make it easy to understand and extend.

------------------------
🎯 Learning Outcome
------------------------
This project demonstrates your ability to:

Work with classes and objects in C++

Use friend functions for class collaboration

Handle real-world logic like shopping and banking

Implement secure and user-friendly features with validation
